# Path Finder Algorithm Visualizer
<<<<<<< HEAD
Using Dijkstra's algorithm, visualize the shortest path. You are able to draw walls which well tell the algorithm to avoid those walls in order to determine the shortest path. Developed using Django and python
=======
Using Dijkstra's algorithm, visualize the shortest path. <br /> Create walls by holding down the mouse while dragging it around the grid .<br /> Developed with django, python, javascript, jquery, html/css
